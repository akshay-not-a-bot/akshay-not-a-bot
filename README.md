# Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub Profile

I'm a self-taught **Python Developer** with a passion for building efficient and scalable applications. My journey started with a strong interest in problem-solving, and now I'm focused on developing real-world projects using Python and its ecosystem.

I have completed **Harvard's CS50P (Programming in Python)** and **Backend Development 2025 (Python) from Udemy** certifications. Currently, I'm solidifying my knowledge, exploring best practices, and looking for opportunities to showcase my skills through projects, collaborations, and work opportunities.

## üöÄ What I'm Working On

- üå¶ **CS50P Final Project:** A Python-based Weather App with Tkinter, Open-Meteo API, and SQLite.
- ‚úÖ **PyDo (TaskByte):** A to-do list web app using Django, Jinja2, and Bootstrap.
- ‚ö° **Exploring Backend Development:** Working on API integrations, database management, and performance optimization.
